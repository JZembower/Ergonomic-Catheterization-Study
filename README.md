# Ergonomic-Catheterization-Study
Looking at sex and operator based differences with ergonomic risks in the catheterization laboratory in this Harvard research study. I showcased the stratifications from the various data that was collected in the Brigham Hospital. Data was collected using IMUs and EMGs through the Noraxon software. I compiled my analysis from the Noraxon excel reports. Data collection is finalized but this is an ongoing analysis, as it has just been submitted for research abstracts in presentation platforms. One currently has been submitted at SCAI.
